COMMENT "The 'object_catalog' table is used to index all DICOM images and zip files containing series of images. The table contains metadata about various objects in the 'pixels_solacc' dataset. It includes details such as the file path, modification time, file size, and file extension. Additionally, it provides information about the object's tags and metadata. This table can be used to manage and organize the catalog of objects, as well as to perform various analyses on the data. For instance, it can be used to identify the most recently modified objects or to filter objects based on their tags."
