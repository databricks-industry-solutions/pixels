## About DICOM
![Dicom Image processing](https://dicom.offis.uni-oldenburg.de/images/dicomlogo.gif)
[Per OFFIS computer science institute](https://dicom.offis.uni-oldenburg.de/dcmintro.php.en)

DICOM® — Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine — is the international standard for medical images and related information. It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use.

DICOM® is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With hundreds of thousands of medical imaging devices in use, DICOM® is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging Standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM® images currently in use for clinical care.

Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM® has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM® has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM® is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients.

DICOM® is recognized by the International Organization for Standardization as the ISO 12052 standard.

## Quick Start
```python
# imports
from dbx.pixels import Catalog                       # 01
from dbx.pixels.dicom import *                       # 02

# catalog all your files
catalog = Catalog(spark)                                    # 03
catalog_df = catalog.catalog(<path>)                        # 04

# extract the Dicom metadata
meta_df = DicomMetaExtractor(catalog).transform(catalog_df) # 05
 
# extract thumbnails and display
thumbnail_df = DicomThumbnailExtractor().transform(meta_df) # 06
 
# save your work for SQL access
catalog.save(thumbnail_df)                                  # 07

## Installation

To run this accelerator, clone this repo into a Databricks workspace. Attach the `RUNME` notebook to any cluster running a DBR 10.4 LTS or later runtime, and execute the notebook via Run-All. A multi-step-job describing the accelerator pipeline will be created, and the link will be provided. Execute the multi-step-job to see how the pipeline runs. The job configuration is written in the RUNME notebook in json format. The cost associated with running the accelerator is the user's responsibility.
